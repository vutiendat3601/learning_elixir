- The basic principles of data abstraction in Elixir can be summarized as follows:
  + A module is in charge of abstracting some data.
  + The moduleâ€™s functions usually expect an instance of the data abstraction as the
    first argument.
  + Modifier functions return a modified version of the abstraction.
  + Query functions return some other type of data.
